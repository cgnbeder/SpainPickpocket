{"cells":[{"source":"# **How Do Social and Economic Variables Influence Pickpocketing Rates in Spain?**\n## **What is Pickpocketing?**\nPickpocketing refers to the act of stealing someone's bag, wallet, or mobile phone without them noticing. It typically occurs in crowded areas, tourist spots, or public transportation. These crimes are often executed using distraction techniques, and the victim usually realizes their belongings are missing after the pickpockets have left the scene.\n\n## **Situation in Europe**\nAccording to [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2023/09/05/italy-france-spain-which-european-country-is-worst-for-pickpockets), thousands of people every year deal with the nightmare of having their valuables stolen while abroad. Tourists are often targeted as they are less aware of their surroundings. In this article, Euronews used data from a British insurance company called [Quotezone](https://www.quotezone.co.uk/travel-insurance/guides/pickpocketing-statistics-in-europe). The company conducted research on pickpocketing activities in the top 10 most visited European countries. The data ranks the most popular European holiday destinations based on the proportion of visitor reviews mentioning pickpocketing at each country's top five tourist spots. Based on data analysis by Quotezone.co.uk, Greg Wilson, Founder and CEO of Quotezone.co.uk, said that unfortunately, this new research shows that thousands of people have complained about pickpockets in Europe while experiencing the best that European holiday destinations have to offer. He continued to talk about ways to protect oneself from pickpockets and the activities of their company in this regard. The results of the research conducted among British tourists are as follows:\n\n![Tourists-Pickpocketing](plots/Tourists-Pickpocketing.png)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"01ec76be-148e-4a05-b47c-1f92697aca4c"},{"source":"This data shows the number of UK tourists who visited other countries in the first three quarters of 2023 and, based on reports by those tourists, the pickpocketing rates in those countries.\n\nBased on this data, if we consider that the bars represent the number of tourists and the line represents the pickpocketing rate, Spain hosted approximately 14 million UK tourists, yet the pickpocketing rate per million visitors is 111. This equals a total of roughly 1,554 UK tourists who faced pickpocketing. On the other hand, although Italy has only a quarter of the UK tourist number compared to Spain, the pickpocketing rate per million visitors is 4.3 times higher. With a rate of 478 per million visitors, that means almost 1,816 UK tourists faced pickpocketing in Italy. Lastly, in France, the rate per million visitors is 251, resulting in a total of around 1,807 victims.\n\nIf we examine the data for these three countries, which receive the most UK tourists, we can see that the total number of pickpocketing victims is almost the same in Spain and Italy due to the higher number of UK tourists in Spain. However, according to the statistics for the first three quarters of 2023, despite Spain hosting 14 million UK tourists, it has the lowest rate both in terms of the per million visitors index and the approximate number of victims among these three countries. (Also, [Euronews](https://www.euronews.com/travel/2024/05/02/remain-vigilant-europes-most-heavily-pickpocketed-tourist-spots-revealed) published another article about pickpocketing using the same data from Quetozone.

However, Spain has a very bad reputation for pickpocketing in traditional and social media.\n\n## **Situation in Spain**\nAccording to a report on Barcelona's pickpocketing statistics on a website called [Bobarno](https://bobarno.com/barcelona-pickpocket-problem/), the city faced an alarming number of thefts, especially during the 2009 tourist season. It was reported that 115,055 pickpocketing incidents occurred over the course of 12 months, averaging 315 thefts daily. However, when considering unreported cases and the concentration of thefts during peak tourist months, the real figure is estimated to be closer to 6,000 thefts per day. This is primarily attributed to the presence of both local and transient thieves who target visitors, taking advantage of crowded areas and the high volume of tourists. Many thefts go unreported due to the time-consuming and arduous process of filing a police report, which often deters victims from seeking official action. Despite efforts to address the issue, the level of petty theft in Barcelona remains significantly high, making it a concern for both authorities and tourists alike.\n\nBut because these statistics are from 2009, a lot of things have changed since then, especially social and economic situations.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7411168c-f0b9-4375-b279-78bd11066fdc"},{"source":"## **What's Changed?**\nAs technology continues to develop over time and globalization accelerates exponentially, both positive and negative consequences have emerged. Particularly today, the internet has become a very accessible tool, leading people in third-world countries with low living standards to realize the existence of a better quality of life. This realization has prompted them to migrate to other regions, either legally or illegally, in hopes of a better future. Mass migrations from regions such as the Middle East and Africa have caused the borders of the destination countries to become increasingly permeable. This is due to the inadequacy of the defense forces in these countries and the undetected or continuous use of migration routes facilitated by technological advancements. These migration movements have brought about various issues, whether intentionally or unintentionally. As a result of mass migrations:\n\n- Communities opting for cheap housing locations to survive in their new countries have led to increased rents due to population pressure. This has caused the local population in these areas to relocate to different locations within the country due to reasons such as incompatibility, alienation, and fear. This domino effect has resulted in increased housing prices in all locations step by step from bottom to top.\n- The influx of people fleeing worse economic and social conditions has created a surplus in the labor market, with many willing to work for wages even lower than the minimum wage in the region. This has led to foreign nationals, especially in labor-intensive jobs, accepting significantly lower pay. For example, while local workers used to earn around €3,000 monthly, immigrants are often willing to do the same job for €1,000. As a result, business owners, in both legal and illegal ways, have increasingly hired immigrants, getting the labor of three workers for the price of one local employee. This shift in hiring practices has driven down wages for the local population and increased unemployment, as workers who previously earned higher wages now seek alternative jobs that match their previous income. The surplus of labor (high supply) combined with limited job opportunities (low demand) has caused downward pressure on wages, particularly impacting new graduates entering the workforce, who face tougher competition for jobs that no longer offer the same pay levels. This dynamic illustrates the classic economic principles of supply and demand, where an excess supply of workers and insufficient demand for labor lead to lower wages and higher unemployment rates.\n- The social pillars of justice, law, and culture in the country have been disrupted due to these mass migrations. Incidents of crime and harassment have increased in the migrated regions due to the application of cultural understandings that do not align with local norms.\n\nHowever, depending on the project's focus, technological advancements have also led to:\n- The widespread use of the internet, allowing people to discover different locations for vacations,\n- Easier and more frequent transportation, resulting in increased tourist numbers and tourism revenues for countries,\n- Valuable items being classified as smaller and more easily portable/storable, such as mobile phones and jewelry.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"82b05a72-24f6-43b6-ba88-b4d59a026d4c"}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.10.12","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
